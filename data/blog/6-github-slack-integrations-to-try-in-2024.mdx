## 1. [Github's Slack App](https://github.com/integrations/slack)

Main features:

- Subscribe to notifications on new commits, pull requests, issues, status updates, comments and code reviews

This is Github's official Slack app - so anything you want to be notified on, it will surely be customizable on the app!

### ‚úÖ Pros:

You can customize what you subscribe to however you want. And it's free!

### üòê Cons:

It can be hard to set up, it took us some time even as developers. The notifications can also be overwhelming and messy, our team found it to be spammy.

### üí≠ Our thoughts:

Have a try to see if it fits your needs. We personally don't utilize all of its features, we still have it installed we just use one feature and we supplement it with another app.

Here's how their notifications look like:

## 2. [PullFlow](https://github.com/marketplace/pullflow)

Main features:

- AI-enhanced code review collaboration, two-way sync between Github comments and Slack messages.

### ‚úÖ Pros:

A high quality and powerful tool! We love this app and all of its features.

### üòê Cons:

The two-way sync does introduce a lot of noise and notifications to your Slack. If you don't like all of your notifications to be on Slack then this one might not be for you.

### üí≠ Our thoughts:

If you and your team don't mind the extra notification sounds - We think it's definitely worth a try! The pricing \$7/user might be reasonable for some, might be expensive for others.

## 3. [Axolo](https://github.com/marketplace/actioner-for-slack)

Main features:

- Ephemeral Slack channels for PRs. Two-way sync between Github comments and Slack messages. PRs reminders. Standup bot

### ‚úÖ Pros:

Another powerful tool! We love this app and its features. This app has similar features as Actioner, but Axolo has more credibility.

### üòê Cons:

The new Slack Channels and the two-way sync does introduce a lot of noise and notifications to your Slack. If you don't like all of your notifications to be on Slack then this one might not be for you.

### üí≠ Our thoughts:

Worth trying! This will change how your team works (a new slack channel will be created everytime someone creates a Pull request). Some might be opposed to it, some might not.
They have a free plan and paid plans go up to 8\$-16\$/user

---

## 4. [Actioner](https://github.com/marketplace/actioner-for-slack)

Main features:

- Ephemeral Slack channels for PRs. Two-way sync between Github comments and Slack messages.

### ‚úÖ Pros:

This app creates dedicated slack channel for new pull requests. Which will give a lot of visibility on your PRs = making reviews faster!

### üòê Cons:

The new Slack Channels and the two-way sync does introduce a lot of noise and notifications to your Slack. If you don't like all of your notifications to be on Slack then this one might not be for you.

### üí≠ Our thoughts:

Worth trying! This will change how your team works (a new slack channel will be created everytime someone creates a Pull request). Some might be opposed to it, some might not.
The pricing is based on credits, so we can't tell if the pricing is reasonable or not.

## 5. [Toast.Ninja](https://toast.ninja/)

Main features:

- Notifies those involved in the Pull request directly in their DMs (you won't be collaborating on a Slack Channel). They also have analytics and team stats.

### ‚úÖ Pros:

It's a simple app that gets the job done.

### üòê Cons:

Toast is very similar to the Github app but it is streamlined for Slack and has extra features that Github doesn't offer.

### üí≠ Our thoughts:

Worth a try! Their pricing depends on how many users your Slack workspace has. The lowest tier has a maximum of 10 users and is \$39/month, making it almost \$2/user

---

## 6. [PullNotifier](https://pullnotifier.com/) ‚≠êÔ∏è

Main features:

- PR Status + Slack message sync (avoiding noisy notifications). Map repository to specific Slack channel.

### ‚úÖ Pros:

Our personal favorite on this list. It is very simple but it works for so many teams! The app also doesn't disrupt your current workflow and the best part is it's very efficient in sending notifications.

### üòê Cons:

It isn't as feature-rich as other apps on this list, but it's very good at what it does.

### üí≠ Our thoughts:

This app has made our code review workflow better. We can effortlessly check the status of our PRs on Slack without getting bombed with notifications.

They have a free forever plan. The lowest tier has a maximum of 20 users and is \$39/month - making it almost \$2/user
